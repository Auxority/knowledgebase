The prices for outdoor gear can be overwhelming. That's why this page contains some tips that help you find your gear for cheaper prices.

## Price Comparison Websites

A website that should work for price comparisons in almost every country is [Google Shopping](https://shopping.google.com).
The downside is that this only shows local prices.

In Europe there is a website called [idealo](https://idealo.de) that shows prices across Europe.
In addition it allows you to set price notifications and see the price history of the past year.

## Buying Pre-owned

If you want even better deals, make sure to look at pre-owned and refurbished options.
You can use local marketplace websites, Ebay, or Facebook marketplace.
Make sure to take the necessary [precautions](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-to-sell-and-buy-secondhand-things-online-without-getting-scammed/) to prevent yourself from being scammed.

## Outlets

Outdoor websites often offer outlets where products are sold for deducted prices.
One example of this is [REI Outlet](https://www.rei.com/outlet), but make sure to look at other websites too.
