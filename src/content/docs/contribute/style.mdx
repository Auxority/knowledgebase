## Headings

- The heading heirarchy starts at the `h2` level. The page title is an `h1`.
- Keep headings short. `h2` and `h3` headings will appear in the article outline. Preview the table of contents and rephrase to shorten headings if the sidebar entry looks too long.
- Don't end headings with punctuation.

## Writing Style

- Don't include "I" or write in a narrative format.
- Except in the case of guides or tutorials, articles should not include an introduction or conclusion.
- Articles should mainly be about concepts and skills. Avoid talking about specific locations, products, or people when possible.
