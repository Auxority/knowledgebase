```mdx
## This is heading level 2

### Heading level 3

**Here's some bold text**

_italic_

~~strikethrough~~

this is some `inline code`

-   a bulleted list
    -   with sub-bullets
```

:::tip
There are lots of other features available for you to use, such as numbered lists, masked links, embedded images, asides (like this "tip" callout), tables, block quotes, and more.

### YouTube

### Lighterpack Lists

Use the `Lighterpack` component to embed a [Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com) gear list. In this example, we're embedding the list `https://lighterpack.com/r/sl6c8y`. The last part of this url, called the "slug", gets passed to the `Lighterpack` component:

```js
import Lighterpack from '@components/content/Lighterpack.astro';

<Lighterpack slug="sl6c8y" />;
```

import Lighterpack from '@components/content/Lighterpack.astro';

<Lighterpack slug="sl6c8y" />
