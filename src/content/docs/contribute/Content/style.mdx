## Headings

-   The heading heirarchy starts at the `h2` level. The page title is an `h1`.
-   Keep headings short. `h2` and `h3` headings will appear in the article outline. Preview the table of contents and rephrase to shorten headings if the sidebar entry looks too long.
-   Don't end headings with punctuation.
-   Headings should be written in [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).

## Writing Style

-   Don't include "I" or write in a narrative format.
-   If you include an introduction/conclusion, keep it short and to the point.
-   Articles should mainly be about concepts and skills. Avoid talking about specific locations, products, or people when possible.
