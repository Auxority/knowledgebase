## Article Structure

Articles are written using MDX. Each article is its own `.mdx` file, which contains a metadata section and a content section:

```mdx title="src/content/docs/example.mdx"
---
title: Example Article
description: A demonstration of how articles are structured
---

This is the content of the example article!
```

Metadata about the article lives at the top of the file, between two sets of `---` tags. The content of the article goes below the second `---` tag.
